# SharePoint Security Sync

[SharePoint Security Sync](https://www.inogic.com/product/productivity-apps/dynamics-365-crm-sharepoint-security-metadata-sync) is a comprehensive solution for integrating Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM with SharePoint for document management. Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM comes with native integration to SharePoint. With SharePoint Security Sync, the idea is to enhance the user experience and further build upon the integration to make the integration experience seamless between the two systems by not just allowing for associating document folders against CRM records but also sync the security privileges from Dynamics 365 CRM to SharePoint to ensure secure and reliable access to confidential documents stored in SharePoint.

**Important**

* **Around 30 million items or files can be stored in a SharePoint list or library but SharePoint has a security scope limit of 50,000 items per list or library with unique SharePoint permissions. Click** [**here**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/troubleshoot/lists-and-libraries/error-share-break-inheritance) **to know more.**&#x20;
* **This limitation exists in SharePoint 2010 and all following versions.**&#x20;
* **Systematic organization of documents by creating list or libraries per period like (Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly) using plugin or flow will effectively lower the chances of hitting the said limit.**&#x20;
* **For any further queries on how to systematically organize a library, please feel free to mail us at** [**crm@inogic.com**](mailto:crm@inogic.com)****
