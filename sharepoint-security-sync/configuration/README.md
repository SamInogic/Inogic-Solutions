# Configuration

SharePoint Security Sync has the following configurations:

* [Connector Configuration](https://docs.inogic.com/sharepoint-security-sync/configuration/connector-configuration)
* [Entity Configuration](https://docs.inogic.com/sharepoint-security-sync/configuration/entity-configuration)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Disclaimer:** The initial **** background process after the creation of Connector and Entity Configuration could take longer (could run for 3-4 hours) if there are high number of Users, Business Units or both.&#x20;

Users --> More than 300&#x20;

Business Units --> More than 10

Therefore, it is recommended to configure the application during off hours. This will ensure that other user activities are not hampered.
