* Enter the required information in the following fields --> Click on **Save.**
  * **Schedule Name:** Descriptive name of the Delayed Charge Schedule.&#x20;
  * **Product:** The Product that will represent the Delayed Charge on the Invoice/Order&#x20;
  * **Frequency Option:** The frequency of which to charge a penalty on Invoice/Order. For example, if you choose monthly, every month after the days past due count there would be a separate delayed charge line on the Invoice or order. Suppose the **‘Due date’** is set to 21st March and **‘Days past due’** count is set to 15 then the first delayed charge will be applied on 5th of April and on 5th of every month. The frequency options available are as follows:
    * Once&#x20;
    * Daily&#x20;
    * Weekly&#x20;
    * Monthly&#x20;
    * Quarterly&#x20;
    * Semi-annually&#x20;
    * Annually
  * **Percentage:** The percentage of the Invoice amount to be charged as a penalty.&#x20;
  * **Days Past Due Count:** Determines the number of days past due before the delayed charges are triggered.
