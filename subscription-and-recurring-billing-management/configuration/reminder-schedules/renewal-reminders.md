# Renewal Reminders

Apart from sending reminders for due payments, reminders can also be sent to renew subscriptions. The process is the same as explained in [Reminder Schedules](https://docs.inogic.com/subscription-and-recurring-billing-management/configuration/reminder-schedules) just with a minor difference - set the **‘Is Subscription Reminder’** field to **‘Yes’** and then go on to create a reminder schedule to renew subscriptions which can be associated with the respective subscription schedule. Now, as set in the reminder schedule when the end date is nearby an automated reminder will be sent to the customers for renewal of the subscription. A similar reminder will also be sent to owner of the subscription schedule (salesperson/user) intimating about the subscription renewal.
