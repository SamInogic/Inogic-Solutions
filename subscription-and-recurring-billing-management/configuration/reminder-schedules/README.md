# Reminder Schedules

The Reminder Schedule is used to set up a reminder for customers regarding their billing. For example, create a Reminder Schedule for invoices that are past due or for upcoming renewals of services, memberships, or software. This is a helpful reminder to customers that a penalty could be incurred if not paid on time. The Reminder Schedule is assigned to the Subscription Schedule and is displayed on the Invoice when it is created.

### How to Create a Reminder Schedule:

* Navigate to **Subscription and Recurring Billing Management App --> Schedules --> Reminder Schedules --> Click on ‘New’ button.**
