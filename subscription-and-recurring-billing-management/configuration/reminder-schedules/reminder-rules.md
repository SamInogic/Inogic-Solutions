# Reminder Rules

The Reminder Rule is used to create the rules around the Reminder Schedule, such as how many days before it is due the mail should be sent and the email template to be used. The Reminder Rule can also be set to email the Invoices to the customers. When the invoice is generated, an email will be sent to the customers along with the attached invoice notifying them about the due payment. You can assign multiple Reminder Rules to a Reminder Schedule. With each rule, the email verbiage can change with each one that is sent. For example, the first e-mail may be a friendly reminder but those sent later may be a little more direct.

### How to Create a Reminder Rule:

* Go to **Subscription and Recurring Billing Management App --> Schedules --> Reminder Schedules.**&#x20;
* Open the **Reminder Schedule** to which you wish to add the rule --> In the Rules section, click on **‘New Reminder Rule’** button to add a new rule.

* Enter details in the following fields or any other needed fields.
  * **Reminder Rule Name:** Descriptive name of the Reminder Rule.&#x20;
  * **Reminder Type:** This field defines the type of reminder set by the user. It has the following options:&#x20;
    * **Document Reminder:** This the normal reminder sent to the customers for payments due.&#x20;
    * **Subscription Reminder:** This is the reminder sent to the customers for subscription renewal.&#x20;
    * **Document Generation Mail:** This is the reminder set for sending email to customers as and when Invoice/Order is generated.
  * **Reminder Schedule:** The Reminder Schedule associated to which the Reminder Rule is being created. This is a required field as a Reminder Rule cannot exist without a Reminder Schedule and would be auto populated when created from the subgrid on Reminder Schedule.&#x20;
  * **Days Before Due Count:** Number of days before an Invoice is due and when the Reminder Rule will be triggered. For example, 5 means the rule is 5 days before the Invoice is due. This also can contain negative values e.g.: -5 means 5 days after the invoice has been due.&#x20;
  * **Functional Role:** The Functional Role assigned to this Reminder Schedule Rule. The Functional Contacts assigned to this Functional Role will receive the reminders.&#x20;
  * **Is Acknowledged Option:** The Reminder Detail will only process if the **‘Is Acknowledged’** setting on Invoice matches the selected option. The following options are available.
    * **Send if Acknowledged -** The reminder will be sent even if the Invoice has been acknowledged.&#x20;
    * **Send if not Acknowledged -** The reminders will be sent if the Invoice has not been acknowledged.&#x20;
    * **Send in Either Case -** The reminders will always be sent until paid.
  * **Attachable Report:** Identifies the word template you may want to associate with the Reminder Schedule. When specified, this word template will be generated in context of the Invoice and attached to the email being sent. This is an optional field.&#x20;
  * **Email Template:** The email template to be used when the reminder is sent. This would be a template already created within Dynamics 365. You may create as many templates as you like. By default, Subscription and Recurring Billing Management ships two email templates to use with Reminders. The Email templates needs to be either Global or on Invoice entity or on Order entity.
    * Document Past Due Reminder&#x20;
    * Upcoming Document Due Reminder
  * **Send Email From Option:** Determines whether the email will be sent from a queue, owner or a user. Depending upon your choice the below fields will be unlocked.
    * **Send Email From User:** Allows you to choose a User from whom to send the email. The selected user must have given the permission **'Allow other Microsoft Dynamics 365 users to send email on your behalf'.**
    * **Send Email From Queue:** Allows you to choose a Queue from which to send the email.&#x20;
    * **Send Email From Owner:** Email will be sent from the owner of the record.
  * **Send To Functional Role:** Determines to whom the email generated by the Reminder Rule shall be sent. The following options are available:
    * **Bill To Customer –** If this is selected then the [Functional Contacts](https://docs.inogic.com/subscription-and-recurring-billing-management/setup-areas/functional-contacts) associated with [Functional Role](https://docs.inogic.com/subscription-and-recurring-billing-management/setup-areas/functional-roles) and associated with **‘Bill To Customer’** of the Subscription Schedule will receive the mail. For e.g., If Alpine Ski House is set as the **Bill To Customer** on Subscription Schedule, then if George of Alpine Ski House has functional Role BA and on the Reminder Rule if Functional Role selected is BA, then the Email reminder will be sent to **George**.&#x20;
    * **Ship To Customer -** If this is selected then the [Functional Contacts](https://docs.inogic.com/subscription-and-recurring-billing-management/setup-areas/functional-contacts) having the [Functional Role](https://docs.inogic.com/subscription-and-recurring-billing-management/setup-areas/functional-roles) for the customer in the **Ship To Customer** of the Subscription Schedule, will receive the email. For e.g., If Alpine Ski House is set as the **Ship To Customer** on Subscription Schedule, then if George of Alpine Ski House has functional Role BA and on the Reminder Rule if Functional Role selected is BA, then the Email reminder will be sent to **George.**
  * **Send Cc Functional Role:** Drives the Cc line when generating the email for a Reminder Schedule Rule. The following options are available:
    * **None –** Nothing will be set in Cc while sending the email reminder.&#x20;
    * **Bill To Customer -** If this is selected then the Functional Contacts having the functional role for the Customer in the Bill To Customer of the Subscription Schedule, will be selected in Cc in the email and will receive the email.&#x20;
    * **Ship To Customer -** If this is selected then the Functional Contacts having the functional role for the Customer in the Ship To Customer of the Subscription Schedule, will be selected in Cc in the email and will receive the email.
