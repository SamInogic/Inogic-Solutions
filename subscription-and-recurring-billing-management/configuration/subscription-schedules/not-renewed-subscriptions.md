# 'Not Renewed' Subscriptions

Once the subscription period is completed, the customers will either renew the subscription or will cancel it. If the customers don’t renew the subscriptions, then the next step is to mark that completed subscription as **‘Not Renewed’**. This can be done by clicking on the **‘Not Renewed’** button available on ribbon. You can access this button at the following levels:

* **On Subscription Schedule Home View** – Here, you can mark multiple schedules as **‘Not Renewed’** at once. Just select the schedules and click on **‘Not Renewed’** button.

* **On Subscription Line Form** – If there are multiple products in a schedule and the customer has not renewed subscription for one particular product, then you can select that product and click on **‘Not Renewed’** button to mark that subscription line as churned.
