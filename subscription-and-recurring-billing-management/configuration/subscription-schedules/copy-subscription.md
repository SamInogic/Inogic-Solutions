# Copy Subscription

We have added a **Copy** button on the form Ribbon of the Subscription Schedule using which you can clone the subscription schedule record along with the Subscription Lines. This will be helpful when your subscription ends and you want to renew your subscription for which you need to create a new subscription. By using this button, the process will be simplified as it will create new subscription with all the details from your previous subscription.

**Note: On copying the Subscription Schedule only those Subscription Lines will get carried over which have the associated product having the ‘Charge Type’ as ‘Recurring’.**
