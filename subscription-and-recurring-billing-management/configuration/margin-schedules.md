# Margin Schedules

The Margin Schedule is used to assign the details of the margin offered to the partners. In B2B transactions sales are made through partners. Here, a percent of the sales is offered to the partners as commission. With Margin Schedule users can define the percentage offered to partners and bill it accordingly.

### How to Create a Margin Schedule:
