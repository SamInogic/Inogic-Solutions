# Functional Contacts

The Functional Contact entity is used to create a contact and assign them to a Functional Role. A Functional Role may have multiple Functional Contacts and a Functional Contact may have multiple Functional Roles. The relationship between a role and a contact is housed in the Functional Contact.

| Functional Contact | Functional Role |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| Alexa              | Billing         |
| Gunnar             | Billing         |
| Jane               | Accounting      |
| Gunnar             | Accounting      |

In the example above, **more than one person** appears in the same **Functional Role** and the user **Gunnar**, belongs to more than one **Functional Role**.
