# Functional Roles

The Functional Role is a custom entity that is used to create roles pertaining to business processes or business roles. Functional Roles are assigned to a Functional Contact(s). Multiple roles can be assigned to contact(s).&#x20;

When Reminder Schedules are generated, the system uses the Bill To Customer/Ship To Customer on Subscription Schedule to look up Functional Contacts associated with that Account. It then filters to the Functional Role to determine to whom to send the reminder email.

### How to Create Functional Roles:

* Got to **Subscription and Recurring Billing Management App --> Others --> Functional Roles -->** Click on **‘+New’** button.
