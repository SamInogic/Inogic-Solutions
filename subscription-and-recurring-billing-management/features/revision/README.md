# Revision

It is normal for customers to update or revise subscriptions they have paid for. Revision can be related to plans, number of users or price range. In such cases, Subscription and Recurring Billing Management gives provision to revise the existing subscription schedule and generate new Invoices or Sales Orders. Once revised, the invoice or sales order will be generated based on the new values stated in subscription schedules.

Subscription Schedules can be revised in the following ways:

* [Through Subscription Lines](https://docs.inogic.com/subscription-and-recurring-billing-management/features/revision/revise-subscriptions-through-subscription-lines)
* [Through Opportunity/Quote/Order](https://docs.inogic.com/subscription-and-recurring-billing-management/features/revision/revise-subscriptions-through-opportunity-quote-order)
