# Revise Subscriptions through Opportunity/Quote/Order

Existing Subscription Schedules can also be revised through Opportunity/Quote/Order. For example, one of the customers has subscribed for the product at the starting of the month and wants to increase the subscriber count from midway through the month. Here, you can create a new opportunity record and revise the subscription schedule through it.&#x20;
