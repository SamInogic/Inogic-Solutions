# Field Mappings

InoLink seamlessly synchronizes data between Dynamics 365 and QuickBooks. Individual fields of the records from Dynamics 365 CRM are mapped to relevant fields of the records in QuickBooks for error-free data synchronization. Here, we will describe the field mappings for the following entities:

* [Account](https://docs.inogic.com/inolink/references/field-mappings/account)
