# Link Existing Customers and Products

InoLink is a robust solution to integrate Dynamics 365 CRM and QuickBooks. It provides you the functionality to link existing Customers and Products in both the systems. Especially when you have already been using both Dynamics 365 CRM and QuickBooks, and have records created and maintained in both the systems and now, you would only like to link the records from both systems so that updates start moving between the systems.

You will use this option when you have already been using both CRM and QuickBooks and have records created and maintained in both the systems and now you would only like to link the records from both systems so that updates start moving between the systems. The **Smart Match button** will try to auto-match the records based on the name of the both **QuickBooks** and **Dynamics 365 CRM** records.

Select the **Account/Contact** from the required **Saved View** along with the type of records from both systems to be linked.

There are three options available for further filtering of the records being displayed for linking.

* **Show all records:** By default, **'Show all records'** is selected. When it is selected it will fetch all the customers irrespective of whether they are already linked or not.
* **Show linked records:** When **'Show linked records'** is selected it will fetch all the customers those are already linked between the two systems.
* **Show unlinked records:** When **'Show unlinked records'** is selected it will fetch all the record from Dynamics 365/CRM which are not linked.
