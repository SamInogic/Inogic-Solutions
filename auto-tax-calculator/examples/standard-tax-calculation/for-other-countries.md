# For Other Countries

If Tax Calculation Country is set to Other on Inogic settings then tax calculation is done depending upon the tax schedule set on Product.&#x20;

On product entity, under the Tax processing tab there is **‘Tax schedule’** field wherein you can set the tax schedule according to which the tax will be calculated.
