# Avalara Tax Calculation

If an Invoice for a particular product is created then with **‘AvaTax’** integration all the taxes will be calculated on the basis of tax rates defined in Avalara for that particular product.&#x20;

### Example:

An Invoice is created on which the customer selected is **A Datum Corporation**. Its address is 2000 Main Street, Irvine, CA 92614. Now, due to integration with Avalara, depending upon the address the tax is calculated.

And the bifurcation of the taxes calculated will be available in the **‘Tax Processing’** tab.

The same bifurcation can be seen in **Avalara** also.
