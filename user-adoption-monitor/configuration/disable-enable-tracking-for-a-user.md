# Disable/Enable Tracking for a User

On the System Users form, we have a section called User Adoption Monitor where you can define whether to enable or disable User Adoption Monitor tracking for the selected user.

Set the **Enable User Adoption** to **No** __ to not track any actions of this user.&#x20;

**Last Touch** would show the last date of any action for this user was tracked.
