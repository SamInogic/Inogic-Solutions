# Target Tracking

With the help of **‘Target Tracking’** in User Adoption Monitor, one can allot and keep track of targets assigned to users in Dynamics 365 CRM. It could either be a target set against the count of the respective entity action(s) or a target against the aggregate value of fields with respect to an entity action performed by the user.

#### Target based on Aggregation Value

#### Target defined for Fixed Interval
