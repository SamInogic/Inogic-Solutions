# Data Quality

**‘Datacompleteness’** feature of User Adoption Monitor helps user to ensure the completeness of the entity record. It gives user the provision to choose which of the fields from the records of selected entity need to be filled in to make sure that the record is complete. In case any of these defined fields are left blank, then the completeness of the record would be reflected as **‘Incomplete’** until the specified field(s) have been duly filled. This function is also applicable for **history records**. In this way, you can keep track and ensure completeness of records in Dynamics 365 CRM and maintain data quality.

The below screenshots give an idea on the **Completeness** fields when placed on the header of the form.
