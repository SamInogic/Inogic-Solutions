# Create Plan For Custom Groups

If your organization doesnâ€™t use any Business Process Flow, then sales managers can set up plans in custom groups. For example, if you are a manager in a finance company and want to create a plan for loan verification with Plan steps for home verification without using Business Process Flow, then you can create a plan on custom groups using the Business Process Checklist app.

With this feature, you can create both **Process** and **Checklist -** type plans on **Custom Groups.** To do the same, the user has to follow the steps given below:

* ****[**Process-Type plan for Custom Groups:**](https://docs.inogic.com/business-process-checklist/features/manage-plans/create-plan-for-custom-groups/process-type-plan-for-custom-groups) In a Process-Type plan for Custom groups, tasks can only be performed in a pre-defined order.
* ****[**Checklist-Type Plan for Custom Groups:** ](https://docs.inogic.com/business-process-checklist/features/manage-plans/create-plan-for-custom-groups/checklist-type-plan-for-custom-groups)In a Checklist-Type plan for Custom Groups, tasks can be performed regardless of the set order.
