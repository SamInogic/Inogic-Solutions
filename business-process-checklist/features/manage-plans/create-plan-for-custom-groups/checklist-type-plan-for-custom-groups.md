# Checklist-Type Plan for Custom Groups

To create plans for Custom Groups where the tasks of the plan can be performed independently regardless of the set order, you need to create a **Checklist-Type** plan for Custom Groups. Where you can proceed to the next task before completing the current one.

This proves useful for creating flexible plans for Custom Groups where your salesperson can perform tasks based on their requirements of the business process, irrespective of the order of tasks set in the plan.

To create a Checklist-Type plan for Custom Groups, follow the steps given below:

* **Fill in the following details:**&#x20;
* **Name:** Provide a unique name for the plan.
* **Description (Optional):** Provide a short description of the plan.
* **Plan Type:** Select Plan Type **** as **Checklist**.
* **Record Type:** Select the **Record Type** for which the plan will be created. (E.g. Lead, Opportunity, Case, or Custom record type etc.)
* **Priority Order:** Users can attach multiple plans to a single record, for which it is necessary to define which plan needs to be connected to the record first. To do this, you can set the priority order against the plan (if the criteria are matching with three different plans, then the plan that has to be followed, we need to set the priority order number respectively). Any value less than 1 or repeated numbers are invalid for this priority order field.
* **Set criteria for the execution of the Plan (Optional):** Set the criteria against the plan (the plan will automatically attach against those for which the criteria match). Select either **Simple** or **Advanced.**
  * **Simple:** Execute plans based on the conditions defined in view of an entity.
  * &#x20;**Advanced:** Execute plans **** based on filter criteria or conditions (conditions defined in Fetch XML).
* Select **'Custom Groups'.**
* Once the required fields are filled, click on **‘Save’**.
