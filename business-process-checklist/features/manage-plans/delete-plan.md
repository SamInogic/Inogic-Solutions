# Delete Plan

You can delete plans that are no longer in use by your organization, and they'll be deleted from the Business Process Checklist app. You can delete active or inactive plans. When you delete an active plan, the records that were connected with the plan earlier will still have those plans attached to them, but no new plan will be attached to the new records added.

To delete existing Plans, Plan Steps, and Plan Step Actions for both Process and Checklist-Type plans, follow the steps given below:
