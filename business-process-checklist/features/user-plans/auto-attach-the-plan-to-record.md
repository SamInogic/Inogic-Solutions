# Auto-Attach the Plan to Record

Plans defined by the manager will automatically get attached to the records as per the matched criteria.

**Below is an example:**

* Now, the manager has created a plan for lead nurturing for the lead entity, where the criteria is set as lead source as "Web".

* Navigate to **Sales Hub -->** Go to **Leads -->** Create a **New Lead** with source as **Web.**

* So, whenever the lead is created with the lead source as **"Web"** then the lead nurturing plan will get attached to that lead record.
