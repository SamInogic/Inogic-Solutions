# Auto-Attach the Plan to Record

Plans defined by the manager will automatically get attached to the records as per the matched criteria.

**Below is an example:**

* Now, the manager has created a plan for Lead Nurturing for the Lead entity, where the criteria are set as "Lead Source as "Web".

* Navigate to **Sales Hub -->** Go to **Leads -->** Create a **New Lead** with source as **Web.**

* So, whenever the lead is created with the Lead Source as Web then the lead nurturing plan will get attached to that plan.
