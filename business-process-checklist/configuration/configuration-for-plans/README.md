# Create Plan

Every organization has its own best practices and plan of action for completing its business processes most effectively.

Creating a plan helps you make business processes consistent by defining the tasks you want your users to perform and the order in which you want them to perform them.

This lets users focus on their core work, thereby increasing their efficiency and helping them understand their next plan of action.

Managers can create two types of plans based on business requirements:

* ****[**Process-Type plan:** ](https://docs.inogic.com/business-process-checklist/features/manage-plans/create-plan/create-process-type-plan)In a Process-Type plan, tasks can only be performed in a pre-defined order.
* ****[**Checklist-Type plan:**](https://docs.inogic.com/business-process-checklist/features/manage-plans/create-plan/create-checklist-type-plan) In a Checklist-Type plan, tasks can be performed regardless of the set order.
