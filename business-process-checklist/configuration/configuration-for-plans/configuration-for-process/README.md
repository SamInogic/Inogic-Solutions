# Create Process-Type Plan

Sometimes managers need to have a plan where the sequence of the tasks matters. And the user should not be able to proceed to the next task before completing the current one. A Process-Type plan is a type of plan that enables managers to create plans that are needed to be performed in sequential order.

This is useful for creating plans where you want your salesperson to follow the guidelines in a predefined order and not randomly.
