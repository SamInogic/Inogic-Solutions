# Plan Step Action

Plan step actions are activities that can be added to a task/plan step to define what activities a salesperson needs to undertake in a specific way to successfully perform a task. For example, in plan step actions, we can define actionable steps like sending a follow-up email or verifying lead details via phone call, etc.

To Add a **Plan Step Action**, follow the steps given below:

* Click on **ellipsis --> '+ Create Action'** to Add an action.

* This will open a **‘Quick Create Form: Plan Step Action’,** where we need to fill in the details**.**
  * **Select Action:** Select an activity (Phone Call, Email, and Tasks) through which you want to carry out a task.
  * **Title:** Your plan step action title is the same as your plan step name, but you can modify the Plan Step Action title as per your requirements.
  * **Description (Optional):** Provide a short description of the plan step action.
  * **Select the Email Template:** You will see this option only if email activity is supported.
    * **Auto Send Email (Optional):** Auto Send Email allows users to automatically send emails for the intended activity. By default, it is set to **No**.
    * **Email Template:** If you want to send a specific type of email automatically to perform a task, you can select an appropriate Email Template from the drop-down menu. If the **Auto-Send Email** is selected as **Yes,** the Email Template field is mandatory to fill.
  * **Set criteria for the execution of Plan Step Action:**
    * **Execution Order:** Enter the execution order for Plan Step Action in which the Plan Step Action will be executed.
    * **Criteria Mode (optional): Criteria mode** defines the criteria of the records on which the Plan Step Action will be applicable and executed. Select either **Simple** or **Advanced**.
      * **Simple:** Here, you can further define and set criteria for records through the view of an entity.
      * **Advanced:** Here, you can further define and set criteria for records through fetch XML.

In this way, **Process-Type plan** can be created with the plan steps and plan step actions.

This is the type of plan you need to create when you need the tasks to be executed in a predefined order.
