# Plan Step

Plan steps are tasks that are needed to be performed to carry out a plan. These plan steps consist of multiple activities called "Plan Step Actions," which define how to effectively perform a certain task in a plan_**.**_

Plan steps help managers define what a task is, why it needs to be performed, and how to perform it.

To create **Plan steps**, follow the steps given below:

* Once the plan is created, navigate to **Manage Steps**.

* Click on the **Create Plan Step** button.

* This will open a **‘Quick Create Form: Plan Step’,** where we need to fill in the details**.**
  * **Name:** Provide an appropriate name for the Plan Step.
  * **Description (Optional):** Provide a short description of the Plan Step.
  * **Add a waiting period for this step (Optional):** A waiting period can be added to define when the plan step should be performed. Once the waiting period is over the plan step actions within the plan step can be performed to eventually complete the plan step. For example, if there is a plan step for getting the lead details and the waiting period for it is set as 2 hours then the plan step actions within the plan step can only be performed after the waiting period ends.
    * **Days:** Add the desired waiting period for this step to be performed after **'X' Days.**
    * **Hours:** Add the desired waiting period for this step to be performed after **'X' Hours.**

Now that we have created a plan step, let’s add [plan step actions](https://docs.inogic.com/business-process-checklist/features/manage-plans/create-plan/create-process-type-plan/plan-step-action) next.
