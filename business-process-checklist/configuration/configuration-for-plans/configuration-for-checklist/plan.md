* This will open the **'New Plan'** page. Here, you can fill in the details and set the conditions for Plan Checklist based on which plan will be executed.
  * **Name:** Give an appropriate name to the plan.
  * **Description:** Give a short description of the plan.
  * **Plan detail settings:** Set the priority order and select the plan type.
    * **Plan Type:** Select Plan Type **** as **Checklist.**
    * **Priority Order:** Set the execution order against the plan (If the criteria is matching with three different plans, then which plan has to be followed, for that we need to set the priority order number) Any value less than 1 or repeated numbers are invalid for this priority order field. ****&#x20;
  * **Record Type:** Select the **Record Type** to which the plan will be attached
  * **Set criteria for the execution of Plan:** Set the criteria against the plan (so that if the criteria satisfy then the plan will run against those for which the criteria matches.) Select either **Simple** or **Advanced**.
    * **Simple: Execute plans** based on the View of an entity.
    * **Advanced: Execute Plans** based on filter criteria or conditions (conditions defined in Fetch XML).
