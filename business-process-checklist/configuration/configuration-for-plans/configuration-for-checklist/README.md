# Create Checklist-Type Plan

To create plans where the tasks of the plan can be performed independently regardless of the set order, you need to create a **Checklist-Type** plan. The checklist is a type of plan where you can proceed to the next task before completing the current one.

This proves useful for creating flexible plans where your salesperson can perform tasks based on their requirements of the business process, irrespective of the order of tasks set in the plan.
