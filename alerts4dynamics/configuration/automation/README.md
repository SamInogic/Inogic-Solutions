# Auto-dismiss Alert Notifications

This provision allows user to decide if they want an alert to auto dismiss once the record moves out of the rule/condition defined while configuring an alert. This is only applicable for the following alert types:

* [Rule-Based Alerts](https://docs.inogic.com/alerts4dynamics/configuration/automation/rule-based-alert)
* [Event-Based Alerts](https://docs.inogic.com/alerts4dynamics/configuration/automation/event-based-alert)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note: Auto dismiss feature is not applicable for announcement alerts as they do not put on any specific condition/rule unlike Rule-based alerts. This feature also supports Record-based alerts only if the alert is configured as advanced message type.**
{% endhint %}
