# Notifications

### View Notifications

Every alert message is shown to the users as **Notifications**. The Notifications button is on the ribbon and can be accessed from anywhere in the CRM.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note: Notification button appears only when you have active notifications in the system.**&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Whenever there is a new notification a red dot comes on the Notification button. Once the notification is read this **Red dot** disappears.

### How to dismiss Notifications?

Notifications can be dismissed at any time. There are two ways to dismiss Notifications:

* **Dismiss Alerts individually:** Every alert can be dismissed individually by clicking on cross icon next to it.

* **Dismiss all Alerts at once:** All the alerts can be dismissed at once by clicking on **Dismiss All** button.

#### Dismissible Alert Notifications

If user sets **‘Is Dismissible’** field as **‘Yes’** then the alert can be dismissed. In this case, ‘**X**’ button will continue showing up on the alert notification indicating that the alert notification is dismissible.

If user sets **‘Is Dismissible’** field as **‘No’** then the alert cannot be dismissed. In this case, **‘X’** button will not be displayed on the alert notification indicating that the alert notification is non-dismissible.

**Note:**

* **By default the value of the field ‘Is Dismissible’ will be ‘Yes’**&#x20;
* **Despite setting dismissible as ‘No’, alert will still be dismissed if the respective notification is deactivated or the ‘Display until’ date of the alert message is already passed**
