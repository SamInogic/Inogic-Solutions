# Create & Modify Game Rules

Game Rules are not written on stone. They are always modified to suit the circumstances of the game. In Gamifics365, you can easily modify existing rules as and when required. But the existing rules can only be modified if you have been assigned the **Gamifics365 Administrator** or **Gamifics365 Manager** security role.

To modify existing game rules, follow the steps given below:

* Navigate to **Gamifics365 app --> Administration --> Gamifics365 Studio** --> Go to the **existing rule** you want to modify --> Click on the **ellipses (the three small dots)**.

* A number of options will be displayed such as – **View Rule, Clone Rule, Activate, Deactivate and Delete**. Now just click on **‘View Rule’**.

* Make the required changes to the rule --> Click on **‘Modify Rule’**.
