# Clone Games

Gamifics365 allows you to create a new game by cloning an existing game in the system. To clone the game, click on the **‘Clone Game’** button available on the ribbon bar.

The game will be cloned and you can make necessary changes such as the date, name, type of the game, and save it. And if the name of the game is kept as it is then the **‘copy’** word will be added to its suffix to differentiate it from the existing game.
