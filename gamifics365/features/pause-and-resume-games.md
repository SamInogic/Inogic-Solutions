# Pause & Resume Games

What happens if you want to stop an ongoing game? Gamifics365 also gives provision to pause and resume ongoing games. You can pause the game by clicking on the **‘Pause Game’** button.  And after clicking on this button, the status of the game will be updated to **‘Paused’**. Once the game is paused, the points of players will remain as it is. Any points earned during the period when the game was paused will not be added.

When the game is paused, the ‘Pause Game’ button will be replaced by **‘Resume Game’** button. You will have to click on the **‘Resume Game’** button to start the game. Once the game is resumed, points will be added as when the points are scored by the players.
