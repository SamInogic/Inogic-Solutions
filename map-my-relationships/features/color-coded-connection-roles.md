# Color Coded Connection Roles

Color legends are shown inside connection relationship view based on the connection roles using which the records are connected to the main/primary entity record. This will help the users to easily identify the connection roles as illustrated in the below example:

* A contact record **‘Abraham McCormick’** is connected to **‘4G Enabled Tablets’** opportunity through **‘Technical Sales Professional’** connection role
* An opportunity record **‘CDMA Phones’** is connected to **‘4G Enabled Tablets’** opportunity through **‘Account Manager’** connection role
* An account record **‘Southridge Video’** is connected to **‘4G Enabled Tablets’** opportunity through **‘Delivery Professional’** connection role
* An opportunity record **‘Smart Phones’** is connected to **‘4G Enabled Tablets’** opportunity through **‘Service Professional’** connection role

This connection role is also visible to user by hovering over the edges as shown below;

### Quick Records Open ( Hyperlink)

Map My Relationships also gives you the provision to navigate to the actual connection record (may it be of any entity) by clicking on the record hyperlink.

If you are standing on the connection grid and wants to quickly navigate to the actual connection record, then just click on the record hyperlink.
