# Filter Records

Map My Relationships gives provision to set filter on entity node views. Users can select the desired view from the dropdown and view the relationships or connections between the records. Users can set a default view while configuring the relationship map just as shown below:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Filter View Config\_1.png>)

Apart from this, users can also select the desired view for any entity node within the relationship map.
