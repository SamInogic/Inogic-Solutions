# Connect Records

Once the connection control is established, you can further drill N-level down through the records within the connection relationship view and connect any record to the main primary record as a connection.

For example:

Consider that a user wants to drill through the records within the connection relationship view and connect a specific record to the main primary record (to create a connection).&#x20;

In this connection relationship view, account **‘A Datum (Sample Data)’** is the main record and it has 2 associated opportunities, and user can further drill through **‘Expressed interest in A. Datum X line of printers’** opportunity record to see its contact.
