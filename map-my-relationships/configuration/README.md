# Configuration

Map My Relationships solution has two custom controls â€“ **Map My Relationships** and **Map My Connections.**

**Map My Relationships** view is a reusable component that can be used and configured for any system (OOB) or custom entities. In a nutshell, to add Map My Relationships view for any entity we first need to add a field(Text Type of field) on the form and need to bind the 'Map My Relationships' control to that field.

Given below are the detailed steps for the same:

* [Set parameters to bind Relationships](https://docs.inogic.com/map-my-relationships/configuration/set-parameters-to-bind-relationships)
* [Advanced Configuration](https://docs.inogic.com/map-my-relationships/configuration/advanced-configuration)

**Map My Connections** control, as the name suggests would focus only on managing the connections for a respective entity record. The idea behind developing this connection control is to simplify the way of creating and updating the connections and manage them efficiently. This control allows user to see the connections in both grid as well as relationship view format (Network Style UI).
