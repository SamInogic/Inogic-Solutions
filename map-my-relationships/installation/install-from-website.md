Now, if you want to upgrade the solution to its latest version or reinstall the same solution, then you will get the following dialog box. Here, select the highlighted **'Upgrade'** point and the **'Overwrite customizations'** point for installing the latest solution. And for reinstalling the same solution, just select the **'Overwrite customizations'** point. Lastly, click on **Import** to start the installation process.&#x20;
