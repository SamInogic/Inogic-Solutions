# Additional Settings

The **Additional Settings** tab has the following fields:

* **Set file size limit for attachments –** Maximum file upload size can be 50 MB.&#x20;
* **Set blocked file extensions for attachment –** This contains the list of file extensions (semicolon separated) which the Connector won’t be able to upload on Cloud. You can enter it as per your preference. **e.g., txt;docx**&#x20;

Click on **save** and the **‘New Connector’** is created with a form notification as “Click on Authenticate button to authenticate the connector”.
