# Deep Search

Users can deep search for files/folders related to the entered keyword in the search tab and obtain all the documents with the search name in the enlisted file area. Deep search allows you to search for files or folders based on your current path. If you are currently in **'/A.Datum/Sample'** path and if there are more folders/files inside that path, if you search for any keyword itâ€™ll scan till the last file and folder and return the result.&#x20;

Azure Blob Storage does not support deep search but user can search within the current folder. For Azure Blob Storage '**Search'** word is **case sensitive.**
