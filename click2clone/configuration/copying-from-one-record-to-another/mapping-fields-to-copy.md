# Mapping fields to copy

The next step is to map the fields under **'Fields Mapping'** section. Here, the mapping will copy the name of an opportunity to the name of an order. Attributes listed on the left hand side belong to opportunity entity and on the right hand side we are selecting the field from an order entity to which the field selected on the left hand side will be copied.

* Go to **Fields Mapping** section --> Select the **fields** --> Click on **Save**.
