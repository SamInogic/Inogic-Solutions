The lanes are defined based on the unique value options supported for the specified field. The product currently supports all field types except complex field types like Customer and Multi-Select Optionset for defining lane categories.&#x20;

Hide Empty lanes using the filter option provided at the top. Do note if the lanes are hidden, you will not be able to move the cards to the said lane and thereby update the record to that status.&#x20;

The field to be used for lane categories can be defined when configuring the Kanban View Component for a view as shown below.
