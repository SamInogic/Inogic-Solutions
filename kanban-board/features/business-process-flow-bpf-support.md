# Business Process Flow (BPF) Support

Organize and categorize records of a given entity in Kanban view as per the Business Process Flow defined for that entity.  A **Business Process Flow** comprises **Stages** that are followed while any transaction goes through various transition phases.

Here, 2 pins will be seen besides each of the Business Process Flow.

* The dark blue pin is the **Global pin**. The BPF on which Global pin is used will be pinned for all the users using Kanban Board.
* The white pin is the **Personal pin** which is used for pinning BPF for a specific user. The BPF on which Personal pin used by a particular user, say User A, will be pinned only for that user.
