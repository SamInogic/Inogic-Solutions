# Drag and Drop

Ability to drag and drop the cards across columns to quickly update the values of the underlying category field.

Kanban Board presents a Kanban view of the records presented as compact cards. The product supports moving the records around from one lane to another with a quick drag and drop action. This also results in updating the corresponding field value appropriate to the data value of the lane.
