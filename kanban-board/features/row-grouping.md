# Row Grouping

Categorize and group records in row based on any field value. For example depending upon on priority – **High, Normal, Low.**&#x20;

The cards (records) can be dragged and dropped from one row to another. As a result, the field of that record is updated in both lane & row.&#x20;

You can also **expand / collapse** these rows through a toggle icon beside the row title and through the icon beside lane header you can toggle all the rows in a lane.

The field to be used for row categories can be defined when configuring the Kanban View Component for a view as shown below:

Another factor seen in **Row Grouping** is the **‘Drop Zone’.** This field will let you drag and drop records from one lane to another lane and update only the lane criteria. It is automatically enabled for non-option set fields in row filter criteria.
