# Context Aware

Works in context of the native CRM environment and responds to all native ribbon actions available for traditional views.

**Kanban Board has been created as a Dataverse (Power Apps) Component.** This means that you can use this control to replace the default visualization available for the views in CRM. The component is context-aware which means that you are allowed to perform any action from the ribbon bar by selecting the cards as you would in the traditional view upon selecting a record.

Apart from the ribbon it also responds to filtering options from Charts.
